  <h1>2.1 Atributos de los sistemas y aplicaciones basados en web</h1>

  <p>Web-based systems and applications have specific attributes that differentiate them from traditional desktop applications. These attributes are critical for ensuring that web applications meet user needs, are scalable, and can operate effectively in a distributed environment.</p>

  <h1>2.1.1. Scalability</h1>
  <p>Scalability refers to a system’s ability to handle increasing amounts of work or its potential to expand to accommodate growth. In web applications, scalability is crucial because the number of users or transactions can grow rapidly. A scalable web application should be able to handle more requests without compromising performance. There are two types of scalability:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Vertical Scalability: Increasing the capacity of a single server by adding resources like CPU, memory, or storage.</li>
    <li>Horizontal Scalability: Adding more servers to distribute the load, often achieved through load balancing.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Real-World Example: Amazon’s e-commerce platform is an excellent example of a scalable web application. As demand increases, Amazon can distribute the load across multiple servers worldwide.</p>

  <h1>2.1.2 Availability</h1>
  <p>Availability is the ability of a system to remain accessible and operational at all times. High availability is achieved by minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can access the application whenever needed. Techniques to ensure high availability include redundancy, failover mechanisms, and geographically distributed servers.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Redundancy: Keeping backup systems in place so that if one fails, another can take over.</li>
    <li>Failover: Automatically switching to a backup system when the primary one fails.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Real-World Example: Google’s search engine is designed to be highly available. Even during maintenance or unexpected outages, users can still access the service.</p>

  <h1>2.1.3 Security</h1>
  <p>Security is a critical attribute for web applications due to the risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Key security features include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Encryption: Ensuring that data transmitted between the client and server is secure (e.g., using HTTPS).</li>
    <li>Authentication and Authorization: Verifying user identities and ensuring they have the correct permissions to access resources.</li>
    <li>Data Protection: Protecting sensitive data like passwords and personal information from being exposed or stolen.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Real-World Example: Online banking platforms like PayPal implement strong encryption protocols and multi-factor authentication to secure user data.</p>

  <h1>2.1.4 Performance</h1>
  <p>Performance measures how quickly a web application responds to user requests. Users expect fast load times and smooth interactions, so optimizing performance is crucial for a positive user experience. Key factors affecting performance include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Server Response Time: The time it takes for a server to process a request and return a response.</li>
    <li>Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transmitted over the internet in a given time.</li>
    <li>Caching: Storing copies of frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce server load and improve response times.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Real-World Example: Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook optimize performance by using content delivery networks (CDNs) to deliver images and videos more quickly.</p>

  <h1>2.1.5. User Experience (UX)</h1>
  <p>The user experience is critical for the success of a web application. UX encompasses everything from the visual design to the ease of use and responsiveness of the application. A well-designed web application should be intuitive, fast, and accessible across a range of devices.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Responsive Design: Adapting the layout and functionality of a web app to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
    <li>Accessibility: Ensuring that people with disabilities can use the web application effectively.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Real-World Example: Airbnb’s web application provides a highly intuitive user experience, with responsive design that works seamlessly on mobile devices and desktop computers.</p>

  <h1>Assessment Questions (Multiple Choice)</h1>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
        How does responsive design enhance the user experience of a web application?
        <ul>
            <li>A. By making the web application look the same on all devices.</li>
            <li>B. By improving the security of the application.</li>
            <li>C. By adapting the application’s layout to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
            <li>D. By increasing the processing power of the application.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        What techniques can be used to improve the performance of a web application with a large number of users?
        <ul>
            <li>A. Reducing server capacity and decreasing bandwidth.</li>
            <li>B. Adding more layers to the web architecture.</li>
            <li>C. Implementing caching and using content delivery networks (CDNs).</li>
            <li>D. Increasing response times by decreasing server power.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Why is encryption important for web applications, and how does HTTPS help secure communications between a user and a server?
        <ul>
            <li>A. Encryption makes the web application load faster, and HTTPS allows higher bandwidth.</li>
            <li>B. Encryption protects sensitive data, and HTTPS ensures secure data transmission.</li>
            <li>C. Encryption limits user access, and HTTPS hides user identities.</li>
            <li>D. Encryption only works for large companies, and HTTPS is irrelevant for smaller websites.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        How does redundancy help in achieving high availability for web applications?
        <ul>

            <li>B. By speeding up the connection between users and servers.</li>
            <li>C. By increasing the server's processing power.</li>
            <li>D. By reducing the number of users who can access the system at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scalability, and why might a web application require both?
